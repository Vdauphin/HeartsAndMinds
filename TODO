To do for Hearts and minds before public release:

    - Setup Dev server for playable test
    - Create vehicle + build menu permissions system based on UID's
    - Fix documentation, currently poor english.
    - Remove Vehicle respawns from options (DONE)
    - Setup Ops Base
    - Setup Start Vehicles
    - Setup Player Slots
    - Add Fluers resupply script
        - Create box for CRBN gear


DISCUSSION:
    - Do we add CCP?
    - Do we fix deployable radio item, or just add it.
    - New potentially necessary roles
    - general discussion about what the change would mean.
